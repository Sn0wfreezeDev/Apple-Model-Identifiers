# Apple Model Identifier 

Apple uses model identifiers for every device. You can find them over all places. In some cases it might be useful to get the actual device + the year it was released. 
For this I gathered all current Apple devices (~ 2011 to 2020). 

## Code 
The code is just a very simple Swift file. It contains a huge `switch` statement with all identifiers.
